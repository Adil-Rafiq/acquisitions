This repository contains a practice project based on a **DevOps course**.  
The project follows along with the tutorial from this YouTube video: [DevOps Project Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5FAxTBuNM8).

It demonstrates setting up a Node.js application with Docker, testing, and basic CI/CD practices for learning purposes.
